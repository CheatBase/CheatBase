# Welcome to CheatBase!

Here, you will find a plethora of working cheat codes for any number of retro gaming consoles.

### About the database

The cheats in this database are each manually assigned a category and sometimes a cheat folder name according to a very specific set of guidelines.

* Cheats only get a cheatFolderName if they meet one of the following conditions:
  * They only apply to a "minigame" found within the ROM. This is most games that market themselves as "100-in-1" or "Minigame collection."
  * A large number of cheats have an identical effect/name with one a tiny difference. I only apply this rule if there are 3 or more "sets" and it would make more sense to the user if they were fully separated from each other.
* Cheat categories are designed to describe the "function" of the cheat.
